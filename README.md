### Hi there, my name is Roberto Mas ðŸ‘‹


#####  ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Cloud DevOps projects such as automate the creation of test enviroments and test the project up to date, this will be useful in cases such as hot fixes, but also any other kind of development.


***"To be or not to be?" asked the ROBOT***

### Something always to remember:

Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```

####Example: 
Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.
